          <p class="">The best source for quotes, of course, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh_(book)" target="_blank">the book</a> itself. Every time I read it, some sentence or phrase stands out. For just quotes there are numerous spin-offs, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Pooh-Benjamin-Hoff/dp/0140067477/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523681469&sr=1-3&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+quotes" target="_blank">"The Tao of Pooh"</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winnie-Poohs-Little-Book-Wisdom/dp/1405281278/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523681532&sr=1-4&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+quotes" target="_blank">"Winnie-The-Pooh's Little Book of Wisdom"</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pooh-Book-Quotations-Winnie-Pooh/dp/0525448241/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1523681532&sr=1-2&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+quotes" target="_blank">"The Pooh Book of Quotations"</a>.</p>
